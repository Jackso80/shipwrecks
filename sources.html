          An overview of how trade was affected in the American Civil War. Evidence suggests that the north was not affected much by the war. The northern states had access to a diversified network of trade with Europe. Most major ports were in the northern states, union states, that would have been beneficial to the European powers to maintain trade relations with the north. “European merchants and industrialists made their money in the North.” U.S. shipping decreased with most foreign markets, Britain held steadier, shipping decreases are not as extreme in the north as in the south.

          Europe, North America, and Asia constitute the primary shipping routes. Both historic and contemporary routes are based around the three continents. Shipping routes are affected by various conditions including wind, tides, and ocean depth. Major shipping ports are located on all inhabited continents, but most developments occurred in eastern Asia in the last half-decade.

          This article focuses on the proposition of north-south market trades globally using shipping routes as well as focusing on how to innovate the east-west trading routes as well for large scale vessels. These shipping routes also include volume traffic to determine the market ranges between shipping lines. It then goes on to talk about how the east-west shipping routes were entered the South American market to conduct further trades between more developed countries and third world countries to minimize the potential danger between shipping and marketing trades across these routes. Ultimately, the article goes into detail about the minimization of danger among these high volume trading and shipping routes as well as the innovation of these routes to further expand market trading overseas.

          This paper is about the historical battle of the Atlantic event that occurred during world war 2. This war was about the battle between german u-boats against American submarines that ultimately contributes to the amount of nautical craft that can be found stretched across the majority of the east coast of the United States. The paper goes into more detail about the battle between these two countries overseas and how most of the war happened here, even though it is not talked about, the Battle of the Atlantic was a highly deadly battle, especially for the U.S. because of the stealth capabilities of german U boats. The reason for this is because of german technology advancements in their vessels that surpassed our own which created a disadvantage for U.S. ships because they couldn’t see what they were fighting.

          This article focuses on hull form designs in probable approaches to real-world scenarios and goes into depth about the process of designing these hulls. In short, it explains how it’s designed by considering factors especially in different bodies of water such as oceans, rivers, lakes, etc. These hull designs affect the usage of the hull and where it should be used whether it be in smooth lakes, white water rivers, or extremely active ocean waters. All of these scenarios play a big part in the process of hull design and contribute to the probabilistic design of these hulls in comparison to the deterministic approach of real-world and weathered environments.

          A basic overview of the dominant features of an area. Entries for New Jersey, the surrounding regions, and New Jersey coastal cities reveal several things. New Jersey is primarily a bad location for shipping and deepwater ports because of the prevalence of sandbars. However, this also creates sheltered waterways. New York, to the North, has the largest port in the United States. Sandy hook, which is on the south side of New York Bay, is a small community with Fort Hancock on the bay. New England, north of New York also proves to be a good area to develop deepwater ports. Shipbuilding was an important industry in this region until steamships started to take over. The major cities of New Jersey include Atlantic city, on Absecon Island Atlantic city, started as a fishing village until 1854 when it became a massive tourist destination. Newark, the largest city of New Jersey, without great coast access it is not a major harbor, but the Morris canal was opened in 1832 to move coal from nearby areas. Trains began to eclipse the canal by the 1860s. The capital of New Jersey, Trenton is not a major harbor either but is the entry into the Delaware River. Toms River, and interesting, but the small coastal settlement was a privateering community in the Revolutionary War. Now it is a fishing resort and the inlet into the Barnegat Bay.

          Sea transportation has been the longest-running major method of transportation. Until steamships started to take over in the late 19th and early 20th century the majority of shipping routes were dictated by the dominant winds of the regions. Most shipping in the region was from Western Europe. This is most likely because of limited infrastructure and development in the east. The Suez Canal was opened in 1869 and radically changed the possibilities in shipping. New technologies and infrastructure projects have radically changed the possibilities of shipping. New routes, and ports, and increasing development across the world have opened up new routes and trade opportunities.

        <p>The number of ships grew profoundly in the latter half of the 19th century to meet the demands of globalization. This increase in production often led to a decrease in the care of ships being built, including the integrity of ships. In the year 1873-1874, 411 vessels sank off of the British coast and around 500 lives were lost as well. What was responsible for this was not, in fact, whether or bad seamanship, but instead “ships frequently broke up or fell apart for the simple reason that they were already rotten and worn-out.” Indeed safety regulations were set amid the 1830s. In fact, “ Standards for structural integrity and for limits on loading had indeed been established as early as 1835 by Lloyd’s Register and compliance was a prerequisite for insurance by reputable entities associated with Lloyds.”

          This article explains various ship designs, evolution and adaptation of ship designs, and how and what events inspired them to take place during various time periods and used for specific time periods. For example, the Victorian ship designs were used from 1837 to 1901. This then transitioned to the Early Twentieth Century design used from 1901 to 1932. Shipbuilding technologies increase further into the end of the 1830s implementing iron as shipbuilding material and incorporating screw propeller-driven, which “in this case by a direct-acting engine which applied power directly to the crankshaft.”
          Experimentation with the screw and paddle propulsion in 1845 culminated in a towing contest between the screw-driven HMS Rattler and the paddle frigate. The changeover from paddle powered to screw propulsion occurred and changed gradually over 20 years from the 1840s. In fact, the Cunard Company continued to order paddle streamers up through the 1860s. Britain was able to manufacture engines at lower costs than other countries over the course of the 19th century due to an abundance of many metal items, this contributed to the development of marine steam engines. As engines became more complex, they started being classified solely according to their cylinder technology, or how many cylinders are in the engine. By 1834, implementations of surface condensers, iron for shipbuilding, and screw propellers were significant technological advancements in ship design. Another side note, during this time there was a war called the Crimean War (October 1853 to February 1856), this war was fought to “gain influence over the territories of the declining Ottoman Empire, is considered to be one of the first modern wars because of the tactical use of new technology like the electric telegraph and railways.” What this war showed and inspired for ship designers alike was that pure wooden sail ships were highly vulnerable to fire from (at the time) modern based artillery.
