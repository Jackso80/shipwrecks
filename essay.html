    <h2>Globalizations Correspondence To Technological Advancements and How This Led To An Increase In Ship Wrecks</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Our project focuses on a data spike that occurred between 1850-1900. A span of 50 years where shipwrecks dramatically increased, to explain this, we dove into the surrounding history around these shipwrecks during this period to find any possible outliers or anomalies that inadvertently contributed to this peak in shipwrecks.The overview of our project focuses on the state of technology and globalization during this history, focusing on the history relating to the evolution of ships during this time period.The rapid advancement in ship technologies initially had a detrimental effect on ship safety causing a disproportionate increase of shipwrecks in the post Civil War United States. These technologies include a change in materials used for constructing ships, design of ships, increasing evolution of composite engines, and increased productions of ships as well. This data is relevant to our argument because using different software technology, we can create data visualizations based on this data set to show the historic evolution and relevance of shipwrecks. The advancement in ship design and infrastructure during the 19th century had a dramatic increase in shipwrecks observed off the New Jersey coast in the second half of the 19th century.</p>

    <p>For our sources, we relied on the Dawlish Chronicles, Life At Sea In Merchant Service. This article uses excerpts from the book Wreck of the Copeland at South Shields. Written and published by John Newington Carter in 1861. Carter provides a profound insight into the impact that ship designs had on seamen during the 19th century. The articles illustrated the history of sea merchants' lives during the 19th century as well as describing integral failures within ships and what caused so many shipwrecks during this time. Our other primary source was Historic England, Ships, and Boats: 1840-1950, written by the English Heritage using excerpts from the author, David Noton. This article was published in 2012 and dove into the evolution of contemporary ship design. Our data stems from the New Jersey Maritime Museum's data table and collection of shipwrecks (Onshore and offshore) within the past 300 years. These contributions are somewhat successful because they implement American history as well as the ever expansion of shipbuilding technologies during this time. The scholars also try to conclude an effect on the people associated with the shipwrecks. To elaborate, the people that would use ships as a way to travel between countries and their outlook on ships during these different eras in time. Some argued that no one dared to enter a ship, especially merchants during the 19th century. "The situation was made worse still by the fact that once a seaman had signed on for a voyage – which on occasion poverty might force him to do without having first seen the ship itself – refusal to board could result in criminal prosecution and imprisonment with hard labor, typically for twelve weeks." (The Dawlish Chronicles, John Newington Carter, 1861) The fear of traveling provoked an increase in imprisonment as well because most seamen would refuse to travel by sea and face prison because they knew just how dangerous traversing waters with these ships were.</p>

      Some contradictions within the literature that exist were between the two scholarly articles about the relationship between ship design and safety. One author (David Noton) argues that ship design increased the safety of ships and enforced safety regulations during the early 19th century, while Carter argues that these designs and regulations were not fully implemented until almost the 20th century. This absence creates a disconnect between the authenticity of this history. However, after critiquing multiple sources, it can be incorporated in the fact that these regulations did not take place until the 1890s (John Newington Carter, 1861) With this, we took away that these authors implement factual historical events, we just made the association between them. We realized that the correspondence between the two is paramount in understanding the causes of shipwrecks and what caused their numbers to fluctuate throughout time. What questions need to be answered is how this peak affects shipwrecks as a whole? What were shipbuilding technologies used for safety rather than speed? Do these implementations lead up to the safety regulations being implemented? Or instead, another increase in ship speed and the overlooked safety regulations that should have been put in place? If safety regulations were heavily enforced before the start of the 19th century, would the data have spiked so much, or even at all? The answers to these questions would help us further understand the overall connection and significance of these shipwrecks, and what effect they had on human life surrounding them not just on sea, but people around the world. People that used ships to travel, what were their mindsets and thoughts of sea travel at this time? Was it safe? Or too dangerous to even attempt?

    <p>Throughout this period, technological changes were imminent and increasing at a rather exponential rate. Ship design and engine evolution were amid a breakthrough since the 1700s, and these changes led to faster ships. However, one key point to take away from this is that because these ship designers and engineers were so focused on ship speeds rather than higher aggregate features and safety implementations within the ships, this increased the probability of a shipwreck. When considering the blockade runner ships, high powered composite engine ships that were designed solely for transporting supplies to the confederate armies during the civil war off the east coast. Later on however, to avoid detection, these ships would face dangerous or even deadly scenarios by traversing through the dense fog at night without lights on to avoid detection from union soldiers. Another constituent that played a rather large part in the increase of shipwrecks was the fact that safety statutes had not yet been fulfilled for ships. Instead, ship captains would find any way around safety specifications knowing they were not put into law yet. These encompassing events caused concern for the safety of ships because most of the ships in this period were very feeble, made of rotting wood. These conditions would indeed cause pathogens that led to deadly diseases aboard these ships further exacerbating the dangerous trips. Lastly, we would like to help others understand the history surrounding these shipwrecks, and that there is much more to data than meets the eye, with provocative research, we can conclude that these shipwrecks changed people's views on sea travel during the time, and we would like to express to the audience the real significance of these wrecks.</p>


    <p>To start off, globalization (an integration of cultures and economies across geographic borders) was a large constituent to the overall rise in shipwrecks. Globalization started to take off around the late 19th century as cost of transportation was reduced, and mass production began to take off due to surrounding effects of the industrial revolution (we’ll get into that later). This increase in production and decrease in price of transportation for ships led to an exponential increase in the rise of ship manufacturing as well as the implementations of technological advancements being applied to these ships. To start off, during the early 19th century, composite engines were already being blueprinted and designed, ready for the new era of shipping technologies. These engines started being put in place and designed so rapidly in anticipation of globalization. These factors were paramount during this time because it would give them an advantage in trading. As these economical tensions started to increase overtime towards the latter half of the 19th century, various countries started to increase mass productions of ships. This is where the increase of shipwrecks begin.
    </p>


    <p>Technological advancements, mass production, and an abundance of structurally failing ships. These are all factors that played various positive roles during this era, but led to negative externalities to stem from this. These effects weren’t intentional by all means, but they were overlooked, not examined carefully, and this led to a vast increase in shipwrecks. The factors all played a major contributal part in the increase in shipwrecks due to an absence of safety policies from long battles of legislature, it wasn’t until shipwrecks peaked their highest in two centuries that they finally implemented mandatory safety laws. Mass production led to a substantial increase in ship production, leading to faulty designs to due the fact that these speeds of production didn’t require inspections of built ships, they were just deemed seaworthy. As well as an increase of mass production, the abundance of already failed ships were scattered across british coastal waters and the east coast of the U.S. These ships sunk not because of environmental impacts or geographical hazards, but just because of the fact that these ships were already rotting out and were far from seaworthy.
    </p>


    <p>Technological advancements in composite engines were crucial in terms of economic growth for countries, but this overwhelming increase affected the quality of ships. Engineers were so focused on making ships faster for trade that they overlooked any safety statutes that would even remotely increase the integral features of these ships. “imposition of statutory safety requirements. The most notable was to be the “Plimsoll Line”, still carried on ships’ hulls, which provided visual confirmation that the ship was not over-laden. Legislation was one thing, enforcement of compliance was another, and a battle still lay ahead.” These implementations were fought over for almost 3 decades. Money was so far rooted into the minds of traders that they would find loopholes around safety regulations to trade with their failing ships. These ships included integral features that were in dire need of repairs yet were never fixed due to a scarcity of financial well being for most ship merchants and traders during this time period. In fact, the conditions of ships were so poor that “refusal to board could result in criminal prosecution and imprisonment with hard labour, typically for twelve weeks.  In the 1850s a British prison-inspector reported that three-quarters of all prisoners in gaols in England’s south-west were such seamen. Their crime had been to refuse to sail on vessels they believed to be unseaworthy or which were inadequately manned.” This infers that safety implementations were battled and argued over for years due to the rise of globalization and how it blinded those by a future of wealth when they had a present of unseaworthy vessels. This led to an increase in shipwrecks due to these vessels traversing dangerous waters anyways which ended with the ship sinking somewhere along the east coast of New Jersey near the atlantic, due to the time period that most supplies were traded between New Jersey ports and british ports alike.
    </p>


    <p>An abundance of failing ships. Rotting wood, falling apart, these ships were referred to as coffin ships. Basically meaning that they were doomed to sink if they traversed any open body of water. In fact just off of one port near the british colonies “411 vessels, many small, sank around the British coast, with the loss of 506 lives. Bad seamanship and extreme weather was not responsible in many – perhaps ever a majority – of cases and ships frequently broke up or fell apart for the simple reason that they were already rotten and worn-out.” This was again due to the fact that yes, safety implementations did exist but because they weren’t written into law or even mandated, they were largely ignored. “Standards for structural integrity and for limits on loading had indeed been established as early as 1835 by Lloyd’s Register and compliance was a pre-requisite for insurance by reputable entities associated with Lloyds. There was however no legal requirement to meet such standards”. These created loop holes for sea merchants and ship captains to follow to avoid such implementations. These decisions led to an increase in ship wrecks because merchants would overload these already failing ships so much that they wouldn’t ever stand a chance even against the first serious storm when traversing open waters. “loaded them so heavily that they were frequently incapable of surviving the first serious storm they would encounter.”
