        <h2>About The Project And Authors</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project didn't start with shipwrecks. Alec and I were fascinated with studying and researching astrological figures in space. Such as space anomalies, trajectories, even potentially comparing speeds in space and how they affect the minds of astronauts alike. However, instead of looking to the future, we looked to the past. Shipwrecks. Human error and greed. How globalization influenced economical values within our species to influence rapid technological advancements. How these advancements manifested so quickly, and why this led to more people dying, more ships sinking, and more ships being unable to traverse sea waters. At first, we weren't too excited to start this project. However, as we continued to dive deeper into the history behind these shipwrecks, we realized these wrecks were tied to human error. An error not just in the design of the ships, but the thought process that incurred within. Instead of focusing on the safety, they focused on the money. This is what brought us to where we are now. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To start off with this massive research project, we split up the work between the two of us (Alec and I). I would be assigned with doing a majority of the research while he worked on the majority of the website. I began by finding articles relating to shipwrecks. Unsure about which time period we were going to research, I had a hard time narrowing down my search to a specific time period. It wasn't until we used OpenRefine where we were able to narrow down our time period to just 50 years (instead of the original 300). From here, we were able to correlate an rapid increase of shipwrecks in the late 19th century to a booming rise of globalization. This would be the foundation of our research project. From here, we began to create visualizations that stemmed from this foundation to solidify our findings for the audience to clearly understand what our project is trying to show. This helped us explain as well as illustrating what exactly happened during this time period, and what caused this to happen as well.
