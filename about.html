        <h2>About The Project And Authors</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project didn't start with shipwrecks. Alec and I were fascinated with studying and researching astrological figures in space. Such as space anomalies, trajectories, even potentially comparing speeds in space and how they affect the minds of astronauts alike. However, instead of looking to the future, we looked to the past. Shipwrecks. Human error and greed. How globalization influenced economical values within our species to influence rapid technological advancements. How these advancements manifested so quickly, and why this led to more people dying, more ships sinking, and more ships being unable to traverse sea waters. At first, we weren't too excited to start this project. However, as we continued to dive deeper into the history behind these shipwrecks, we realized these wrecks were tied to human error. An error not just in the design of the ships, but the thought process that incurred within. Instead of focusing on the safety, they focused on the money. This is what brought us to where we are now. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To start off with this massive research project, we split up the work between the two of us (Alec and I). I would be assigned with doing a majority of the research while he worked on the majority of the website. I began by finding articles relating to shipwrecks. Unsure about which time period we were going to research, I had a hard time narrowing down my search to a specific time period. It wasn't until we used OpenRefine where we were able to narrow down our time period to just 50 years (instead of the original 300). From here, we were able to correlate an rapid increase of shipwrecks in the late 19th century to a booming rise of globalization. This would be the foundation of our research project. From here, we began to create visualizations that stemmed from this foundation to solidify our findings for the audience to clearly understand what our project is trying to show. This helped us explain as well as illustrating what exactly happened during this time period, and what caused this to happen as well.

        <h3>Data Critique</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset is an overview of shipwrecks provided by the New Jersey Maritime Museum. The data set, according to the New Jersey Maritime Museum, focuses on the waters of the New Jersey coast, as well as the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River. The information is an aggregate of newspaper stories, ship logs, diaries, the United States Life-Long Service humanitarian group, books, periodicals, and web sources. The database has 4721 entries, from 1705 to 2013, characterizing information from ship name, ship type, year lost, location coordinates lost, and cause of loss. The dataset also provides, where available, information about cargo and personnel losses, whether the ship was recovered, the nature of the cargo, the shipmaster, destination and departure ports, ship year, ship material, and a section for additional information important to the unique incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inconsistencies within the data tables such as the SHIPâ€™S OWNER, YEAR BUILT, and WHERE BUILT. The majority of these categories are empty or unknown. This causes a bit of concern when considering using this data set because it has a lot of missing information that decreases the validity of this data set contributing to our final project. Some additional concerns from this data are that there can be issues if there are significant reasons to believe a ship may have been counted twice. There is a section for AKA which implies that is not completely unheard of for a boat to go under multiple names. There are some logical reasons this could happen, if the boat is sold after operating for some time, perhaps the new operating company will rename it. Other boats may have a common nickname they are known by, while officially operating under another name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The default sorting of the data is alphabetical. The data set seems to display the years the ship was made in but in many cases, especially chronologically early in the dataset. This chronological mishap might make it extremely difficult to correlate the reason for so many ships wrecking at a certain time period or year as age may be a contributing factor to shipwreck incident. Most boats do not have an identified build date until the second half of the 19th century. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a substantial number of boats, around 75, that have no year listed as lost. Most of these have only a name provided and a photo on file. Some have a location lost and a cause of loss, but many of these are unknown. Most of these wrecks probably need to be ignored because of the lack of information around them causes problems with classification. This raises a limitation of the dataset. Since this data is not a purely digitized copy of a historical record we have no way to verify how comprehensive this list of wrecks is. There may be additional unrecorded wrecks. Many of these wrecks that only have a name exist only because of a photo. This raises several questions, how do we know all these boats are even from the greater New Jersey area? What if the name painted on the side of the boat was not identical to the name the boat officially went by? Furthermore, before photography was commonplace many of these boats probably would have gone completely unrecorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a field for whether a ship was lost or not, but many of the early wrecks are unknown, this raises some concern over classification. If just ships that sunk or are permanently grounded are going to be considered much of the data will have to be thrown out because of this omission. Until the mid 19th century seems pretty common for the fate of the boat to be completely unknown, so data from before this will need to look at incidents rather than fates of the boats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the data has a fair share of limitations. There exist records from before the 1850s, but many considerations have to be made when using this data. Additionally, knowing how the data was originally sourced there could be some incidents here that never happened. A location error in an original reporting in a book, newspaper, or another periodical could create an error that would ultimately be unable to be confirmed. Given the state of many of the older records, there could be an issue with underreporting. There are some anomalies in the data that raise a question, one specific set of incidents are the Carrie Gibbs and the Carrie S Webb. These are listed as two different ships that had incidents in almost the exact same location 1 day apart. The type of ship, the departure, and the destination are all identical. The only difference with the incident report is a grounding versus a stranding. The data raises flags about the reliability of the data, when using the data to make claims there needs to be some review of the data to point out the caveats of the claim.
