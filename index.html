        <h2>An Increase In Ship Wrecks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project focuses on an increase in shipwrecks during the 19th century. Our goal is to find out how
          technological advancements during this time period contributed to these wrecks.We decided to focus on a data
          spike that occurred between 1820-1890. A span of 70 years where shipwrecks dramatically increased, to explain
          this, we dove into the surrounding history around these shipwrecks during this period to find any possible
          outliers or anomalies that inadvertently contributed to this peak in shipwrecks. Our project
          focuses on the history relating to the evolution of ships during this time period.The rapid advancement in
          ship technologies initially had a detrimental effect on ship safety causing a disproportionate increase of
          shipwrecks in the post Civil War United States.</p>

        <!--
        <p>During the latter half of the 19th century, technological advancements in ship design and composite engine
          design led to a huge increase in manufacturing and production speed for ships. This led to a major increase in
          the amount of ships being produced in a much shorter time span leading to possible engine failures or integral
          failures within the ships due to no safety policies being implemented and being overlooked. Another major
          factor that played a role in this data spike was the combined effects of the civil war as well as the
          industrial revolution. The industrial revolution led to a huge increase of manufacturing efforts as an effort
          to keep up with globalization. This speed increase led to technological advancements exponentially growing
          around the U.S. as well as a huge increase in the evolution of composite engines being manufactred for various
          ships. This level of increase led to engine failures due to safety inspections not being in place as well as
          no form of safety policies being put in place either. The Civil War during this time increased the demand for
          ships as both armies during this time relied on supplies being delivered for ammunition or food. Special ships
          called Blockade Runners were designed for this very purpose. Fast and versatile, these ships could traverse
          ocean waters at around 25 knots, but structurally, weren't very safe. As well as this, these ships would
          deliver supplies at night and wouldn't run their fog lights to avoid detection from either army. This would
          create a dangerous environment and led to an increase in shipwrecks due to various blockade runners crashing
          against rocks because of impaired visibility.</p> -->
